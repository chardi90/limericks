# AI Limerick Generator
A limerick generator that uses keywords to generate you limkerick-shapped poems on theme using AI. Built with JavaScript using an engineered prompt and axios to fetch poems from an AI API. Designed primarily for mobile.

## Features  
- Search bar for key word input
- Google material icons custom background image
- Loading message

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install the required packages:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/chardi90/limericks.git  
cd limericks  
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

## Usage  

You may want to research alternative dictionary apis. This project currently uses:

[SheCodes Ai API](https://www.shecodes.io/learn/apis/ai)

- API key required

## Development Ideas

If I were to develop this project further I would:
1. Switch to a faster API, perhaps [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/)
2. Engineer prompts for haiku, acrostic and ode poems, then add tabs/dropdown to the top allowing the user to select their preferred form of poetry
